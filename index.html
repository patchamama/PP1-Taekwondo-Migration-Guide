        <h2>Why this page? <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i></h2>
            <p>During my personal development in martial arts, I have practiced for more than 10 years <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Open the wikipedia page of karate to more information.">karate</a></i> in Cuba reaching the green belt (3rd kyu of <i>Jyoshinmon Shorin Ryu</i> style).</p> 
            <p>I have been living in Berlin for 17 years now. In Berlin I wanted to return to martial arts and decided to experiment with <i>Taekwondo</i> and <i>Hapkido</i> (the latter similar to Japanese Aikido), which are martial arts from Korea, and therefore, unlike Japanese Karate, the name of the techniques is different.</p>
            <p>Although in physical practice the techniques are very similar, by changing the name. I initially set out to find documentation, a book or on the web that would give me the equivalents techniques names of Karate technik in Taekwondo (or Hapkido) but I did not find any information. <strong>This content is intended to serve as a guide and help to practitioners who come from a Japanese or Chinese martial art (Kungfu) and who wish to get started with Korean martial arts such as Taekwondo or Hapkido</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Introduction <i class="fa-solid fa-person-military-pointing"></i></h2>
          <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
            <p>The term "martial art" refers to a set of physical and mental practices developed for self-defense, mental discipline, physical development, and general culture. Traditional martial arts have a long history and originated in different parts of the world, such as Asia, Europe, and Africa.</p>
            <p>Martial arts focus on the use of combat techniques, including strikes, kicks, throws, locks, chokes, and submissions, among others. In addition to combat training, martial arts also include a philosophical and spiritual component and focus on the development of discipline, self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-control.</p>
            <p>Some examples of martial arts include karate, kung fu, taekwondo, judo, jiu-jitsu, boxing, kickboxing, and Muay Thai, among others. Each martial art has its own techniques, traditions, and philosophies.</p>
          <h3>Origin</h3>           
            <p>Martial arts have been practiced throughout the world for thousands of years. Some of the oldest forms of martial arts include Greek wrestling, pankration in ancient Greece, Kalaripayattu in India, and sumo in Japan.
            <p>In China, various forms of martial arts, such as Kung Fu and Tai Chi, were developed, while in Japan, Judo and Karate were developed. These martial arts were often closely tied to the religious and philosophical beliefs of their respective cultures.</p>
            <p>As martial arts spread throughout the world, they began to evolve and diversify. In the 1960s, Korean Taekwondo became one of the most popular martial arts in the world, while in the 1970s and 1980s, kickboxing and Muay Thai gained popularity in the West.</p>
            <p>In addition to the traditional martial arts, new forms of martial arts began to emerge in the late 20th century, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, mixed martial arts (MMA), and Krav Maga.</p>
            <p>Today, martial arts are practiced all over the world, and there are many different forms of martial arts, each with its own unique set of techniques, philosophies, and styles. Many people continue to practice martial arts for self-defense, fitness, and personal development, while others compete in martial arts competitions and tournaments.</p>

          <h3>What are the reasons for the emergence of martial arts?</h3>
            <p>The reasons for the emergence of martial arts are varied and complex, and vary depending on the culture and historical context. Some common reasons that have contributed to the development of martial arts include:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>The need for personal defense:</strong> Martial arts were initially developed as a means of personal defense in times of war and conflict, where skill in combat could mean the difference between life and death.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical and mental discipline:</strong> Martial arts have also been historically used as a means of improving physical and mental health, as well as fostering discipline and self-control.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural expression:</strong> Many forms of martial arts have deep roots in the culture and tradition of a region or country. As a result, the practice of martial arts has often been used to maintain and transmit these cultural traditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Sport competition:</strong> Over time, many forms of martial arts have become sports and have evolved to include rules and regulations for fair and safe competitions. Sport competition has attracted many practitioners and has helped popularize martial arts worldwide.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Today, many people practice martial arts for a combination of these reasons, including personal defense, improving physical and mental health, cultural expression, and sport competition.</p>

Our training is holistic, so we place great importance on taking into account all areas of Taekwondo and Hapkido. In addition to modern competitive Taekwondo, we also focus on various traditional exercises. We include two form systems (Poomse and Hyong) and, to a large extent, self-defence, especially in Hapkido, in our training.
