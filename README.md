# Migration Guide from Japanese or Chinese martial arts to Korean martial arts

Welcome!

As part of the first project for my training as a Fullstack Developer I have developed this project that allows me to develop an idea in relation to the change of martial arts practice and at the same time allows me to practice what I have learnt about coding (html+css).

## The idea

The idea of this guide is to facilitate the learning of a martial art starting from an already known martial art and for this point, we start by looking for an equivalent to the positions, strikes and blocks between the known martial arts and the target of learning (Korean, Chinese or Japanese). In general there are always subtle differences (even in these techniques within the styles of the same martial art) and I do not want to find an exact approximation but an idea that allows us to use a known martial art as a reference and from there make modifications and achieve the final technique in the new martial art that we want to learn.
