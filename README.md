# Migration Guide from Japanese or Chinese martial arts to Korean martial arts

Welcome to my first proyect of [Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)!

As part of the first project for my training as a Fullstack Developer, I have developed this project that allows me to develop an idea in relation to the change of martial arts practice to facilitate the learning of a new style or practice, building on previous knowledge of a known practice. At the same time, it allows me to put into practice what I have learnt about coding/layout in my training as a Fullstack devoleper in the [Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net) training programme.

## The goal

The idea of this guide is to facilitate the learning of a martial art starting from an already known martial art and for this point, we start by looking for an equivalent to every position, strike or block between a known martial arts and the target of learning. In general there are always subtle differences (even in these techniques within the styles of the same martial art) and I do not want to find an exact approximation but an idea that allows us to use a known martial art as a reference and from there make modifications and achieve the final technique in the new martial art that we want to learn and thus facilitate rapid learning and adaptation to the new practice.

## Features

To achieve the objectives I have divided the project into 4 main sessions that are included in the menu that is displayed on each page and that always allows you to access them from wherever you are on the site.

- __The landing page image__

  - Three images are included in a salute sequence as part of the martial philosophy of these arts, which are mainly based on the unity and balance of body and mind control.

- __Menu Bar__

  - It includes access to 4 different pages: home, migration, gallery and contact. The menu is displayed on every page, so it is accessible from any section of the page and avoids the use of backtracking options.

- __Why this page? Section__

  - In this section I specify the reason for the content of this page with a brief history and the initial difficulty that determined learning a new martial arts practice without a guide that would allow a quick transition and clarification of the new concepts.

- __Introduction Section__

  - The introduction briefly gives some general concepts such as the meaning of martial art and gives more information about the diverse origin of martial arts and possible causes. 

- __The Footer__ 

  - It is possible to provide the link in the future to the different social networks of the association to which I belong once I provide this information by the coordinators (the information has not been provided).

- __Migration__

  - This is the most important page of the project. A comparative table summarises the equivalents between Korean, Japanese and Chinese martial arts (respectively taekwondo, karate and kungfu) in different techniques of basic stances, striking and blocking techniques. Each practice is specified in a different colour to make it easier to differentiate the content on small screens as the full table cannot be displayed.

- __Gallery__

  - The gallery includes sample images taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) which should be replaced in the future by images from the association.

__Contact__

  - In the contact section there is a reference to the association I am part of with a small reference to the types of training they do. The information was taken from the association's website. There is a contact email, postal address and a link to google maps for more detailed information.
